# Theory of Computing
## Automata Theory

**1930s** : Automata theory is the study of abstract computing devices, or *machines* 
The word automata comes from automation or machine

### The Central Concepts of Automata Theory

**The fundamental question in computer science** What different models of machines can do and cannot do
--->  **The theory of computation**

**Computability vs Complexity** We can compute but it is too complex

**Alphabet** is a set of symbols, from the set a lists of these symbols is a known as **strings** and the set of these strings can be termed a **language**

#### Alphabet

An alphabet is a finite, <u>nonempty</u> set of symbols

```{tip}
By convention we use the symbol $\Sigma$ for an alphabet
```
```{admonition} Example Alphabet
1. $\Sigma\ =\ \Set{0,1}$ the *binary* alphabet
2. $\Sigma\ =\ \Set{a,b,\cdots,z}$ the set of all *lowercase letters* 
3. The set of all ASCII characters or set of all printable ASCII characters
4. Alphanumeric: $\qquad\Sigma\ =\ \Set{a-z, A-Z, 0-9}$
5. DNA molecules: $\ \ \quad\Sigma\ =\ \Set{a,c,g,t}$
```
#### Strings
##### Empty String
This string, denoted $\epsilon$ 
##### Length of a String
Standard notation for length of a string $w\quad is\quad | w |\quad eg\ |011|=3\ and\ |\epsilon|=0$
##### Powers of an Alphabet
We can express the <b><u>set of all strings of a certain length</b></u>

*eg* $\displaystyle\quad\Sigma^1=\Set{0,1}\quad\Sigma^2=\Set{00,01,10,11}\quad\Sigma^3=\Set{000,001,010,011,100,101,110,111} $

```{admonition} Type Convention for Symbols and Strings
We use *lower-case* letters at the **beginning** of the alphabet to denote symbols
and *lower-case* letters at the **end** *eg* $w,x,y\ and\ z$ to denote strings
```

The set of all strings over an alphabet is denoted $\Sigma^*$
*eg* $\quad\Set{0,1}^* = \Set{\epsilon,0,1,00,01,10,11,000,\cdots}$
*another way* $\quad\displaystyle\Sigma^*=\Sigma^0\cup\Sigma^1\cup\Sigma^2\cup\cdots$


When we *exclude the empty* set then the notation becomes $\Sigma^+$
$\Sigma^+ = \Set{\Sigma^0\cup\Sigma^1\cup\Sigma^2\cup\cdots}$
$\Sigma^* = \Sigma^+ \cup  \Set{\epsilon}$

##### Concatenation of Strings
Let $x$ and $y$ be strings
Then $xy$ denotes the *concatenation* of $x$ and $y$

#### Languages

A set of strings chosen from some $\Sigma^*$ where $\Sigma$ being a particular alphabet is called a ***language***

>The only real constraint is that all alphabets are finite, thus a language can only draw from a finite alphabet 

#### Problems

> In automata theory, a ***problem*** is the question of deciding whether a given string is a member of some particular language

## Finite Automata

> A **finite automaton** has a set of states and it's *control* moves from state to state in response to external *inputs* 


### Examples

The circles are known as **states** and the links define **actions**
Double circle is the **end state**
There is a thick arrow that represents the **start state**

--h--> then2(("th"))
--e--> then3(("the"))

end
```



### Deterministic vs NonDeterministic

#### Deterministic Finite Automata

Control is 
**deterministic *DFA*** meaning that the automaton cannot be in more than one state at any one time 
or **nondeterministic *NFA*** meaning that it may be in several states at once

##### Key Components of DFAs'

$\tt{Q}_{\phantom{0}} \Rrightarrow \color{yellow}\text{a finite set of states}$
$\tt\Sigma_{\phantom{0}} \Rrightarrow  \color{yellow}\text{a finite set of input symbols (\color{darkkhaki}{alphabet}})$
$\tt{q}_0 \Rrightarrow  \color{yellow}\text{a start state}$
$\tt{F}_{\phantom{0}} \Rrightarrow  \color{yellow}\text{a set of final or accepting states}$
$\displaystyle \tt{\delta}_{\phantom{0}} \Rrightarrow  \color{yellow}\text{a transition function which is mapping between}
\quad \color{lightsteelblue} \delta:  Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$

$\displaystyle\color{Orange}\text{If q is a state, and a is a input symbol then }\delta(q,a)\\
\text{is that state p such that there is an arc labeled a from q to p}$



A **DFA** is defined by a *5 tuple* $\color{skyblue}{\sf\qquad\Set{Q,\Sigma,F, q_0, \delta}}$

###### How a DFA Processes Strings

A DFA needs to decide wether to <font color="lime"><b>accept</b></font> or <font color="red"><b>reject</b></font> a given set of inputs 

$\tt{a_1a_2\cdots a_n} \Rrightarrow \color{yellow}\text{a sequence of input symbols}$
$\tt{\delta(q_0,a_1) = q_1} \Rrightarrow \color{yellow}\text{We begin at the start state and given the first input symbol we transition to the next state}$
$\tt{\delta(q_1,a_2) = q_2} \Rrightarrow \color{yellow}\text{Next the next input symbol using the transition function we move to the next state}$
$\tt{q_0q_1\cdots q_n} \Rrightarrow \color{yellow}\text{a sequence states that are traversed with the transition functions}$
$\tt{\delta(q_{i-1},a_i) = q_i} \Rrightarrow \color{yellow}\text{In general we keep finding states given this transition functions}$

$\displaystyle\color{Orange}\text{If the last state is the final state, accept or reject if it is not}$

> We can either use a **transition diagram** or a **transition table** to show the automaton

#### Non-Deterministic Finite Automatons
These have the power to be in **several states at once**

They are really useful for searching in a string\
and they are more terse than their DFA counterparts\
they can be converted to and back easily to DFAs

$L = \Set{w\mid w \text{ contains all the strings that end with }00}$

![Dfa & NFA](./FiniteAutomataDrawings/finiteAutomata.svg){width=600px height=400px}

Convert the following NFA into a NFA 
$* \text{ means accepting state}$

&nbsp; | 0 | 1
--: | :--: | :--:
$\rightarrow p$ | $\Set{p,q}$ | $\Set{p}$
$q$ | $\Set{r}$ | $\Set{r}$
$r$ | $\Set{s}$ | $\emptyset$
$*s$ | $\Set{s}$ | $\Set{s}$

define all the subsets $Q_D =\text{ all subsets }Q_n$

&nbsp; | 0 | 1
--: | :--: | :--:
 $\Set{p}$ | $\Set{p,q}$ | $\Set{p}$
 $\Set{p,q}$ | $\Set{p, q, r}$ | $\Set{p, r}$
 $\Set{p,r}$ | $\Set{p,q, s}$ | $\Set{p}$
 $\Set{p,q,r}$ | $\Set{p, q, r, s}$ | $\Set{p, r}$
 $\Set{p,q,s}$ | $\Set{p, q, r, s}$ | $\Set{p, r, s}$
 $\ddots$ |  $\vdots$ | $\vdots$


**Important distinctions between DFAs and NFAs**
The machine never really terminates
*It is always waiting for the next input symbol or making transitions*

The machine decides when to <u>consume</u> the next symbol from the input and when to <u>ignore</u> it
*but the machine can <u>never skip</u> a symbol* 

A single transition *cannot* consume more that one (non-$\epsilon$) symbol

#### FA with $\epsilon$-Transitions
â€¢ We can allow explicit $\epsilon$-transitions in finite automata
â€¢ i.e., a transition from one state to another state without consuming any
additional input symbol
â€¢ Explicit $\epsilon$-transitions between different states introduce non-determinism
â€¢ Makes it easier sometimes to construct NFAs

> **Definition** $\epsilon$-NFAs are those NFAs with at least one explicit $\epsilon$-transition defind

â€¢ $\epsilon$-NFAs have one more column in their transition table

##### Examples of an $\epsilon$-NFA

$L=\Set{w\mid w \text{ is empty, or if non-empty will end in }01}$

 $q_1$ | $\emptyset$ | $\Set{q_2}$ | $\Set{q_1}$ 
 $*q_2$ | $\emptyset$ | $\emptyset$| $\Set{q_2}$ 

Îµ-closures of a state q, <font color="royalblue">ECLOSE(q)</font> is the set of all states (including itself) 
that can be reached from q by repeatedly making an arbitraty number of Îµ-transitions

## Regular Expressions and Languages

*Regular Expressions* are a type of <u>language-defining notation</u>

### Operators of Regular Expression

> **example** $01^*+10^*$ denotes the language consisting of all strings that are either $0$ or $1$ followed by any number of $0\mid 1$s

1) **The union of two languages**\
   $L$ and $M$, denoted $L\cup M$, is the set of strings that are in either $L$ or $M$, or both


2) **The concatenation of languages**\
   $L$ and $M$, is the set of strings that can be formed by taking any string in $L$ and concatenating it with any string in $M$
$$
\color{lightsteelblue}{\textbf{Example}}\\
\begin{aligned}
L=&\Set{001, 10, 111}\\
M=&\Set{\epsilon, 001}\\
L\cup M =&\Set{\epsilon, 10, 001, 111}\\
L\cdot M\ or\ LM =&\Set{10, 001, 111, 001001, 10001, 111001}
\end{aligned}
$$

3) ***Closure or Star, or Kleene Closure***\
   $L$, denoted $L^*$ and represents the set of those strings that can be formed by taking any number of strings from $L$ possibly with repetitions and concatenating all of them
   *eg* $\qquad \color{violet} L=\Set{0,11}$ then $L^*$ consists of those strings where $0$s and $1$s come in pairs
   $\color{lightgreen} 001, 11110$ but not $\color{indianred} 01011, 101$ $LL\cdots L$ concatenation of i copies of L

#### Building Regular Expressions

We will use the three operators <font color="violet">union</font>, <font color="palegreen">dot</font> and <font color="brown">star</font>

1. The constants $\epsilon$ and $\theta$ are regular expressions, denoting the languages $\Set{\epsilon}$ and $\theta$, respectively 
That is $L(\epsilon)=\Set{\epsilon}$, and $L(\theta)=\theta$

2. If $a$ is any symbol, then $a$ is a regular expression
This expression denotes the language $\Set{a}$ That is, $L(\mathbf{a})=\Set{a}$ 
**Note** boldface font denote an expression corresponding to a symbol

3. A variable usually capitalized and italic such as $\mathit{L}$ is a variable representing any language
