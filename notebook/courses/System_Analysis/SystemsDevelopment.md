# Systems Development

[[TOC]]


## Information Systems

*[IS]: Information System

IS
: An organized combination of 
*people*, *hardware*, *software*, *communication networks* & *data resources*
that *collect*, *transform* & *disseminate* **information** in an organization
Example:
<i>Hospital Management Systems streamline patient care,
from admission to discharge, ensuring data accuracy and accessibility</i>

### Key Components of Information Systems

**Hardware** Physical devices like servers, workstations, networking equipment
**Software** Applications and programs used to process and manage data
**People** Users and IT personnel who manage and maintain the system
**Data** Raw facts and figures that are processed to generate meaningful information
**Network** Infrastructure that connects the components, facilitating communication

### Systems Analysis & Design

System Analysis
: The process of examining a business situation for the
purpose of developing a system solution to a problem
It often involves studying processes and gathering system requirements

**Importance of System Analysis in Project**
- Ensures clarity in understanding the project's goals
- Aids in identifying potential challenges
- Forms a foundation for the design, development & deployment phases
- Reduces project risks and uncertainties

System Design
: The phase where the system specifications are detailed
It involves designing the architecture, interfaces and components

### Designing Effective Information Systems
<i>Key principles for robust design</i>
<b>User-Centered Design </b>Focus on the needs and feedback of end-users
<b>Scalability </b>Design should cater to future growth and expansion
<b>Flexibility </b>System should easily integrate with other systems or adapt to new requirements
<b>Security </b>Ensure data protection and user privacy

### Software Development Life Cycle

*[SDLC]: Software Development Cycle

1. #### Planning
   <i>Define the system's scope and objectives</i>
   Align the system with organization goals, identify constraints & allocate resources 
2. #### System Definition
   <i>Gather and analyze requirements</i>
   Involved deep interaction with stakeholders to gather detailed system requirements
3. #### Design
   <i>Detail system specifications</i>
   Here we create the blueprint of the system
   Includes *data structures*, *UI/UX designs*, *system workflows*, etc

4. #### Implementation
   <i>Coding, testing, and installing the system</i>
   Here we converts designs into working code
   Involves unit testing to ensure production functions as intended

5. #### Maintenance & Iterations
   <i>Ongoing updates, bug fixes, and improvements</i>
   After development product needs
   regular fixing of bugs
   regular add new features from feedback

### Agile Methodology
> A shift from traditional waterfall methodology
> > Emphasizing <i>adaptability & collaboration</i>
> > Add breaks and smaller chunks called **iterations**
> > Allowing for *continuous feedback* and *adjustments*

#### Principles of Agile Development
- Embrace change for customer advantage
- Delivering working software frequently
- Collaboration between developers and stakeholders
- Simplicity and focusing on what's necessary

### Extreme Programming

*[XP]: eXtreme Programming

> XP emphasizes customer satisfaction and introduces engineering practices like
continuous integration and test-driven development to improve software quality and
responsiveness to changing requirements

### Scrum

A agile framework, organizes work in **sprints** *short, time-boxed periods*

It includes roles like **Scrum Master** and **Product Owner** and 
ceremonies like <b>Daily Stand-ups</b> and <b>Sprint Retrospectives</b> to keep projects on track

### Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

*[OOAD]: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

> A methodology that models systems as a group of interacting objects
> Each object object represents some entity of interest in the system 
> being modeled and has its own *behavior*, *data*, and *operations*
> > <i> <em>In a hospital system</em>,
> <code>Patient</code> and <code>Doctor</code> can be objects,
> each with their attributes and methods like 
> <code>schedule_appointment</code> or <code>prescribe_medicine</code></i>

*[OOAD]: Object-Oriented Analysis & Design

**Benefits of OOAD** 
&nbsp;&dash; Enhances modularity and reusability
&nbsp;&dash; Facilitates real-world modeling
&nbsp;&dash; Offers better flexibility and maintainability

#### Key Concepts

Class
: Blueprint for creating objects or *instances*

Object
: Instance of a class

Inheritance
: Acquiring the properties of one class by another class

Polymorphism
: Ability of a function or method to work in different ways based on the input

**Challenges of OOAD** 
&nbsp;&bullet; Complexity in designing classes and relationships
&nbsp;&bullet; Potential for engineering
&nbsp;&bullet; Requires deep understanding of the domain

**Real world applications of OOAD** 
&nbsp;&blacktriangledown; E-commerce platforms modeling products, carts, and users
&nbsp;&blacktriangledown; Social media platforms representing posts, comments, and reactions
&nbsp;&blacktriangledown; CRM systems modeling customers, interactions, and sales pipelines

### Rational Unified Process

*[RUP]: Rational Unified Process

RUP is a software development process that emphasizes task structuring and iterative progress
It integrates OOAD 

#### Phases of RUP

1. **Inception** Define the system's vision and scope
2. **Elaboration** Address potential risks and develop a detailed system architecture
3. **Construction** Develop the system, evolving through iterative cycles
4. **transition** Deploy the system to the end-users

#### Key Principles of RUP

- Iterative development
- Managing risks proactively
- Continuous verifications of quality
- Flexibility to adapt to changes

#### Advantages of RUP

- Structured approach to complex projects
- Emphases on stakeholder feedback
- Focus on addressing risks early
- Continuous integration and testing

#### Challenges & Critique of RUP

- Can be cumbersome for small projects
- Demands significant planning upfront
- Potentially higher costs due to its comprehensive nature

### Comparing RUP with other Methodologies

**vs Agile** is more prescriptive, whilst Agile is adaptive
**vs Waterfall** is more iterative, whilst Waterfall is linear
**vs Scrum** more detailed process than Scrum

> The systematic approach to managing projects from inception to completion
>> Provides structure, ensures alignment with objectives, 
>> and increases the chance of project success

### Is Project Management Lifecycle

**The 4 Phases** 

- #### Initiation
  *Setting the projects direction its Scope*
  We establish a clear **project vision** and define its purpose
  this ensures stakeholders have a shared understanding
  & provides a clear roadmap to guide future actions

- #### Planning
  *Outlining the steps, allocating resources and setting the timeline*
  Determines the **how** of the project
  **Resource Allocation** assign tools, personnel and budget
  **Risk Management** identify and mitigate risk
- #### Execution
  *Implement the plans, monitor progress and make adjustments*
  <b>This is where the plan comes to life</b>
  **Challenges** Scope creep & communication gaps
- #### Close-down
  <b>Wrapping up all project activities</b>
  Provides closure to all stakeholders
  Offers post project reflection to learn lessons
  *Complete, assess & transition the project*

## Project Identification and the Rise of E-Commerce

This has a lot to do with **strategic planning & foundations**

### Project Identification

project identification
: Recognizing and defining potential projects
that could meet an organizational need or address and opportunity

## Project Initiation and Planning

Project initiation
: the formal process of defining 
the scope, objectives, & stakeholders for a new project

Important because it sets the foundation for what the project aims to achieve
Enables stakeholders to understand & commit to the project's vision

project planning
: involves setting goals, defining roles & establishing timelines
to ensure a project's success

A detailed plan serves as a roadmap for project execution
Helps in avoiding issues such as scope creep and delays

### Steps

**Project Conceptualization** Develop a preliminary visions for the project
**Stakeholder Identification** Identify and engage people or entities that have a interest in the project
**Resource Allocation** Plan & allocation necessary resources like <i>time</i>, <i>manpower</i> & <i>tools</i>
**Objective Setting** Establish clear, measurable & achievable objectives

**Project plan -**
**Creation** Compilation of all the elements into a cohesive project plan
**Review** Validate the project plan with stakeholders to ensure alignment and feasibility 

### Project Feasibility

> sets the stage for project success by evaluating if the objectives are achievable
> analysis helps to identify and mitigate risks early in the project lifecycle

<u>types </u>
**Technical Feasibility** Evaluates whether the project can be completed with the current technology
 Also assesses the technical skills and resources needed
**Economic Feasibility**
the financial aspects of the project to determine if it is viable from an economic standpoint
**Legal Feasibility**
Reviews legal requirements such as licenses, patents, and regulations that could impact the project
**Operational Feasibility**
Assesses if the organization has or can obtain the necessary resources and
expertise to bring the project to fruition
**Scheduling Feasibility**
Examines if the project can be completed within the defined timeline

**Go/No-Go Decision**
<b>
   A final decision point where all the feasibility studies are evaluated to decide
   whether the project should proceed or be terminated
</b>

### Baseline Plan

After the feasibility analysis

<b>A baseline plan serves as a standard for measuring project performance</b>
It allows for effective project control by providing a comparison between planned and actual outcomes

#### Activities

- ##### Identifying Objectives
  The first step is to lay out the project objectives clearly
- ##### Resource Allocation
  Assigning resources such as manpower, time, and money to different tasks
- ##### Scheduling
  Developing a timeline for all the activities and milestones

#### Steps

1. **Identify Objectives** Establish clear goals for the project
1. **Allocate Resources** Assign necessary resources to achieve these goals
1. **Create Schedule** Develop a timeline with milestones
1. **Stakeholder Review** Get feedback from key stakeholders
1. **Implement Changes** Revise the plan based on feedback
1. **Finalize Plan** Lock in the baseline project plan

### Structured Walk-Through

> This is a review process used to validate the quality and completeness of a deliverable

!!! Danger Enables early detection of issues and fosters team collaboration

#### Roles and Responsibilities

!!! todo Facilitator
      Leads the walk-through and manages the process
