### Site Definition and Planning 
Of course we could talk about target audience, but thier is more to this step than this. You need to prepare a <span class="FireBrick">budget</span> and develope your <span class="BlueViolet">goals and objectives</span>

<b class="SkyBlue"><u>Common Questions</u></b>

* Who will it?
  - **Intranet** - for internal use
  - **Extranet** - sharing information with suppliers
  - **Internet** - communicate with the public

* Will it provide the opportunity for visitors to interact with the site through the use of forms, scripts, shopping carts, or transaction software?

* Where will you post the site?

* How will it be updated? By whom? How will it be evaluated? How often?

### <span title="This is actually called 'designing information architecture'">Information Architecture</span>
Look through existing content and prototype yet to exist content. This step is not about the pretty aspect of design but instead just the functional part of design.

### Site Design 
During this Stage
- Create page grid, page design and graphic design standards
- Create or add any photos, illustrationns or any other audiovisual elements
- Reseach assembling, content editing and organising and writing
- Programming, database design, data entry, and search engine design should be well under way at this point

### Site Construction 
Here create the bulk of pages, thier content and thier linking.Here you should begin beta testing before the site goes live

### Site Markeeting 

The next step is making your website an integral part of your overall marketing campaign. Use the URL in all corporate publications and media ads. List the website in the standard Web indexes like Google and Bing. Then identify ways to partner with other organizations to promote your site and your organization. Web entrepreneurs make good use of partnerships and affiliate programs. You'll want to investigate both.

### Tracking. Evaluation and Maintenance 
We can track visitors to get useful quantifiable data. Make arrangements for ongoing maintenance.
