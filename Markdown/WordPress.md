# Wordpress Development

Why we still need Wordpress Developers 
 
  1. Just because people could teach themselves WordPress doesn’t mean they want to. Lots of people need WordPress experts to develop their website. They might need a low cost web design service such as our MySimpleSite and MySimpleStore websites, or a full priced option.
  2. People get stuck and need help with WordPress.
  3. Companies who have developed or commissioned a custom web design rather than a theme need it converting to WordPress.
  4. Lots of clients need WordPress customization – modifying themes to reflect their brand identity, WordPress plugin development, etc.
  5. Bigger companies need an expert WordPress consultant to integrate WordPress with their existing IT systems and help them get the most out of WordPress.
