## Summary 

> **Note**: Forgive my spelling and grammer this is straight from my mind onto a keyboard.

<span class="DarkViolet">
    I have just completed a 12 weeks intensive full stack web development bootcamp. It was very demanding (from a cohort of 21 to 15 graduating). It was in person but completely changed when Covid 19 struck halfway through becoming a remote bootcamp soon after. I had managed to navigate though this and successfully graduated with a fairly good performance.
    I will make a series detailing my experience for those interested, although this is mostly a reflection on my part.

Funnily enough I also came out of it, more healthier than ever, having lost considerable weight on a strict keto diet, I wasn't even trying to lose weight.

### Initial Perception 

I tend to research everything myself. So I was very clear about my expections, goals and so on. I was already going into bootcamp confident that I can create a website from scratch and fairly proficient in vanilla js, css and other languages, whats more I was fairly skilled at picking up skills on my own. I already was following and completing many tutorials, but found that I had plenty of gaps in my knowlege. Whats more I wasn't confident that I was learning in a efficient order. Questions like should I learn Jquery should I skip Mysql or go to MongoDb constantly was in my mind. 

So for me I needed the following that a bootcamp can provide:
- A structured learning course though a relavant techstack
- Access to career services to get me a job fast 
- Ablity to be mentored by real developers
- Being closer in the industry 
- Work on my interpersonal skills 
- Accelerated Learning (who gots time for anythng else?)
- My backend knowledge was limited
- Learning industry practices and conventions
- Being part of a group that is sharing in my journey
- Proffessional practices (interviews, git workflow, tooling, etc)

I think I probably could have overcomed these without a bootcamp but with too much effort and time wasted. So bassically it all came down to exchanging money for a straighter shot at a career in web developement.
