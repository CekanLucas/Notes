<span class="DarkViolet">
    I have just completed a 12 weeks intensive full stack web development bootcamp. It was very demanding (from a cohort of 21 to 15 graduating). It was in person but completely changed when Covid 19 struck halfway through becoming a remote bootcamp soon after. I had managed to navigate though this and successfully graduated with a fairly good performance.
    I will make a series detailing my experience for those interested, although this is mostly a reflection on my part.
</span>
<p>Funnily enough I also came out of it, more healthier than ever, having lost considerable weight on a strict keto diet, I wasn't even trying to lose weight.</p>
<h3 id="initial-perception">Initial Perception</h3>
<p>I tend to research everything myself. So I was very clear about my expections, goals and so on. I was already going into bootcamp confident that I can create a website from scratch and fairly proficient in vanilla js, css and other languages, whats more I was fairly skilled at picking up skills on my own. I already was following and completing many tutorials, but found that I had plenty of gaps in my knowlege. Whats more I wasn't confident that I was learning in a efficient order. Questions like should I learn Jquery should I skip Mysql or go to MongoDb constantly was in my mind.</p>
<p>So for me I needed the following that a bootcamp can provide:</p>
<ul>
<li>A structured learning course though a relavant techstack</li>
<li>Access to career services to get me a job fast</li>
<li>Ablity to be mentored by real developers</li>
<li>Being closer in the industry</li>
<li>Work on my interpersonal skills</li>
<li>Accelerated Learning (who gots time for anythng else?)</li>
<li>My backend knowledge was limited</li>
<li>Learning industry practices and conventions</li>
<li>Being part of a group that is sharing in my journey</li>
<li>Proffessional practices (interviews, git workflow, tooling, etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>I think I probably could have overcomed these without a bootcamp but with too much effort and time wasted. So bassically it all came down to exchanging money for a straighter shot at a career in web developement.</p>
